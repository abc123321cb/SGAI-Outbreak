# SGAI - Outbreak
This is the repository that Beaverworks' SGAI 2022 will be using to understand
serious games and reinforcement learning.

# The Game:
This game focuses on the spread of disease. In the simulation you can see the Zombies spread and eventually die out.
The players job is to try and arrest the spread of the disease. 

# Controls:
The Goverment Agent is displayed as a vaccinated character with a white background, and is the only player-controlled character in the game.
The Agent can move by clicking on an adjacent tile, or using the arrow keys to move in the specified direction.
Right-clicking an adjacent human will vaccinate them, stopping them from being infected for the rest of the simulation. Curing zombies can be done the same way, giving them immunity to the infection after being cured.
If vaccinated/uninfected humans are near a player, they will head towards the nearest exit, the green boxes, instead of wandering aimlessly. Your goal as the agent is to have as many people either vaccinated or escaped as possible.
